# Mergesort
My humble attempt to write mergesort.

I am reading The Imposter's Handbook by Rob Conery. He explains in
detail how mergesort works. This is a good excercise to write one
and hence this repo.

I had the variable names, a structure, a methology clear in my head
but when I saw it on the screen it looked like a mess. :-)

So some of the variable names makes no sense now.
